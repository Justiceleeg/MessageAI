# Epic 5 Gap Analysis & Resolution - October 23, 2025

**Summary:** Identified and resolved missing data models, calendar UI, and duplicate views

---

## 🚨 **Gaps Identified**

### Gap 1: Thread Summarization (Not in Original Brief)
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Action:** Removed from Story 5.2

**Details:**
- RAG-based thread summarization was added during story writing
- NOT in original AI Features Briefing
- Removed entire feature, simplified Story 5.2 to focus on decision detection only
- Added lightweight RAG for decision context instead

**Documentation:**
- See `docs/ARCHITECTURE-UPDATES-OCT23.md` for full details

---

### Gap 2: iOS Data Models Missing
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Action:** Created Story 5.0.5

**Problem:**
- Story 5.1 assumes `Event` model exists → **DOESN'T**
- Story 5.2 assumes `Decision` model exists → **DOESN'T**
- Story 5.5 assumes `Reminder` model exists → **DOESN'T**
- No `EventService`, `ReminderService`, `DecisionService` defined
- SwiftData entities not configured

**Impact:**
- Story 5.1 **BLOCKED** - Cannot save events without Event model
- All AI features blocked without data foundation

**Resolution:**
- Created **Story 5.0.5: iOS Data Models & Services Foundation**
- 3 story points
- Creates all Swift models, SwiftData entities, and service layers
- Must be completed BEFORE Story 5.1

**Files Created:**
- Models: `Event.swift`, `Reminder.swift`, `Decision.swift`
- Entities: `EventEntity.swift`, `ReminderEntity.swift`, `DecisionEntity.swift`
- Services: `EventService.swift`, `ReminderService.swift`, `DecisionService.swift`

---

### Gap 3: Calendar UI Missing
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Action:** Created Story 5.1.5

**Problem:**
- Story 5.1 Definition of Done says: "Events visible in calendar view" → **VIEW DOESN'T EXIST**
- Story 5.1 Testing says: "View in calendar" → **NO CALENDAR UI DEFINED**
- Story 5.5 AC6 mentions "Calendar tab" → **NOT BUILT ANYWHERE**
- Mijick CalendarView library mentioned in briefing → **NEVER INTEGRATED**

**Impact:**
- Events created but not visible
- No way to test Stories 5.1, 5.4, 5.5
- Poor UX (AI creates things user can't see)

**Resolution:**
- Created **Story 5.1.5: Calendar & Reminders UI**
- 5 story points
- Integrates Mijick CalendarView via SPM
- Displays events in calendar grid
- Displays reminders in list view
- Full navigation to/from conversations
- Real-time updates

**Placement:** Between Story 5.1 and Story 5.2

---

### Gap 4: Duplicate Reminders View
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED  
**Action:** Updated Story 5.5

**Problem:**
- Story 5.5 AC6: "Global Reminders View" in Calendar
- Story 5.1.5 AC6: "Reminders Tab Display" in Calendar
- **SAME VIEW, TWO STORIES** → Duplication of effort

**Resolution:**
- Removed AC6 from Story 5.5 (Global Reminders View)
- Story 5.1.5 owns all global calendar/reminder views
- Story 5.5 focuses on:
  - Reminder detection and extraction
  - Reminder creation modal  
  - **Per-chat** reminders view
  - Notification scheduling
  - Reminder completion
- Clear separation: Extraction (5.5) vs. Display (5.1.5)

**Updated Story 5.5:**
- Renumbered ACs: AC1-8 (was AC1-9)
- Renumbered Tasks: Tasks 1-9 (was Tasks 1-10)
- Added dependency on 5.1.5
- Reduced scope but same story points

## 🔄 **Dependency Chain**

```
5.0 (Backend) 
  ↓
5.0.5 (Data Models) ← MUST BE NEXT
  ↓
5.1 (Event Extraction)
  ↓
5.1.5 (Calendar UI)
  ↓
5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6
```

**Critical Path:**
1. Complete 5.0 (in progress)
2. **MUST do 5.0.5 next** (blocks everything)
3. Then 5.1 (event extraction)
4. Then 5.1.5 (calendar UI)
5. Then remaining stories in any order
