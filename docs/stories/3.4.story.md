# Story 3.4: Implement Notification System (Mock Push for Demo)

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want to** receive notifications for new messages when I'm not viewing a conversation,
**so that** I don't miss important communications.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When a new message is received for a conversation the user is not currently viewing, a notification is delivered (FR8).
2. Notifications work reliably when the app is in the foreground via in-app banner.
3. Notifications work when app is in background via local notifications (iOS native).
4. Tapping a notification navigates the user to the relevant conversation.
5. Notifications are suppressed when user is actively viewing that conversation.
6. A NotificationManager service coordinates all notification logic.

  - [x] Ensure suppression works for both in-app banner and local notifications
  - [x] Add debug logging for suppression decisions
  - [x] Add unit tests for suppression logic scenarios
  - [x] Test: User in Chat A, receives message for Chat B → show notification
  - [x] Test: User in Chat A, receives message for Chat A → suppress notification

- [x] Task 8: Handle Notification Permission Denial (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Detect when user denies notification permissions

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**From Story 3.3: Implement User Presence Indicators (Draft)**
- ✅ **Debouncing & Throttling**: Applied to reduce Firestore operations
- ✅ **Listener Cleanup**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks
- ✅ **Realistic Testing**: Unit tests for logic, integration tests mostly manual

**From Story 3.2: Display Message Read Receipts (Done)**
- ✅ **Batching & Throttling**: Critical for reducing Firestore write costs
- ✅ **Security Rules**: Field-level permissions applied
- ✅ **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging

**From Story 3.1: Implement Basic Group Chat (Done)**
- ✅ **Group Support**: Group name and participant fetching patterns established
- ✅ **Many Tests Deferred**: Focus on unit tests, defer complex integration tests

**From Story 2.3: Ensure Offline Persistence & Optimistic UI (Done)**
- ✅ **NetworkMonitor**: Available for connectivity checks
- ✅ **Offline Queue**: Pattern available if needed

**Key Technical Foundation Available:**
✓ Firebase Firestore for data storage  
✓ Firebase Auth for user identification  
✓ MVVM architecture with Services layer  
✓ Real-time Firestore listeners for messages  
✓ Network monitoring (NetworkMonitor)  
✓ Group chat support with participant fetching  

**What This Story Adds:**
- **Mock Notification System**: Local notifications + in-app banners
- **NotificationManager Service**: Centralized notification coordination
- **Firestore Listener**: Detect new messages for notification triggers
- **In-App Banner**: Beautiful SwiftUI notification banner
- **Smart Suppression**: Don't notify if user is viewing that chat
- **Demo-Friendly**: Fully testable in simulator, no external dependencies

**Key Differences from "Real" FCM Push:**
- ❌ No FCM token management (not needed for local notifications)
- ❌ No APNs configuration (not needed for local notifications)
- ❌ No Firebase Cloud Functions (client-side detection via listeners)
- ✅ Same UX for foreground notifications (in-app banner)
- ✅ Local notifications work in background (iOS native)
- ⚠️ Won't deliver when app is fully terminated (upgrade to FCM later)

**Production Upgrade Path:**
When ready for production with Apple Developer account:
- Create Story 3.5: "Upgrade to Production FCM Push Notifications"
- Add FCM token management
- Add Firebase Cloud Function
- Configure APNs
- Keep same UI/UX components (in-app banner, navigation logic)

### Technical Approach

**Architecture:**

```
New Message Created in Firestore
         ↓
Firestore Listener Detects (NotificationManager)
         ↓
Extract: conversationId, senderName, messageText
         ↓
Is this message from current user? (senderId check)
         ↓
      YES → Ignore (don't notify self)
         ↓
      NO → Continue
         ↓
Is user viewing this conversation? (suppression check)
         ↓
      YES → Suppress (don't notify)
         ↓
      NO → Trigger Notification
         ↓
    App in foreground?
         ↓
      YES → Show In-App Banner
         ↓
      NO → Schedule Local Notification
```

**NotificationManager Service:**

```swift

**In-App Banner Component:**

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct NotificationBannerView: View {
    let title: String
    let message: String
    let onTap: () -> Void
    let onDismiss: () -> Void
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(alignment: .leading, spacing: 4) {
            Text(title)
                .font(.subheadline)
                .fontWeight(.semibold)
                .foregroundColor(.primary)
            
            Text(message)
                .font(.subheadline)
                .foregroundColor(.secondary)
                .lineLimit(1)
        }
        .padding()
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
        .background(
            RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: 12)
                .fill(.ultraThinMaterial)
                .shadow(radius: 8)
        )
        .padding(.horizontal)
        .padding(.top, 8)
        .transition(.move(edge: .top).combined(with: .opacity))
        .onTapGesture {
            onTap()
        }
        .gesture(
            DragGesture()
                .onEnded { value in
                    if value.translation.height < -50 {
                        onDismiss()
                    }
                }
        )
        .accessibilityLabel("New message notification")
        .accessibilityHint("Tap to open conversation, or swipe up to dismiss")
    }
}
```

### Data Models

**No data model changes needed** - Mock notifications don't require storing FCM tokens.

### Database Schema

**No Firestore schema changes needed** - Using existing Firestore listeners on conversations/{conversationId}/messages collection.

### File Locations & Project Structure

**iOS Files to Create:**

```
ios-app/MessageAI/
├── Services/
│   └── NotificationManager.swift        (NEW - notification coordination)
├── Views/
│   └── Shared/
│       └── NotificationBannerView.swift (NEW - in-app banner UI)
└── MessageAIApp.swift                   (UPDATE - initialize NotificationManager)

ios-app/MessageAITests/
└── NotificationManagerTests.swift       (NEW - unit tests only)
```

**No backend files needed** - All logic is client-side using Firestore listeners.

**No integration test files** - All integration testing will be done manually per the Manual Testing Guide.

### API Specifications

**iOS Notification Management:**

```swift
// In MessageAIApp.swift or AppDelegate

import FirebaseAuth
import UserNotifications

@main
struct MessageAIApp: App {
    @State private var notificationManager = NotificationManager()
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .environment(notificationManager)
                .task {
                    // Request permissions after authentication
                    if Auth.auth().currentUser != nil {
                        await notificationManager.requestNotificationPermissions()
                        notificationManager.startListening(userId: Auth.auth().currentUser!.uid)
                    }
                }
                .overlay(alignment: .top) {
                    if notificationManager.showBanner,
                       let title = notificationManager.bannerTitle,
                       let message = notificationManager.bannerMessage {
                        NotificationBannerView(
                    title: title,
                            message: message,
                            onTap: {
                                // Navigate to conversation
                                if let conversationId = notificationManager.bannerConversationId {
                                    NotificationCenter.default.post(
                                        name: .navigateToConversation,
                                        object: nil,
                                        userInfo: ["conversationId": conversationId]
                                    )
                                }
                                notificationManager.dismissBanner()
                            },
                            onDismiss: {
                                notificationManager.dismissBanner()
                            }
                        )
                        .animation(.spring(), value: notificationManager.showBanner)
                    }
                }
        }
    }
}
```

**ChatView Integration:**

```swift
// In ChatView.swift

struct ChatView: View {
    @Environment(NotificationManager.self) private var notificationManager
    let conversationId: String
    
    var body: some View {
        // ... existing view code ...
        .onAppear {
            notificationManager.currentlyViewedConversationId = conversationId
        }
        .onDisappear {
            notificationManager.currentlyViewedConversationId = nil
        }
    }
}
```

- Test: Suppression logic returns false when not viewing conversation
- Test: Permission request stores result in UserDefaults
- Test: Notification payload constructed correctly for 1:1 chat
- Test: Notification payload constructed correctly for group chat
- Test: Banner auto-dismisses after timeout

**Manual Testing:**

**PRIMARY TESTING APPROACH** - All integration testing will be manual. No automated integration tests required.

See "Manual Testing Guide" section below for comprehensive step-by-step instructions.

**Test Location:**
- iOS Unit Tests: `ios-app/MessageAITests/`
- Manual Testing: Follow guide below in Dev Notes

### Manual Testing Guide

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This is the primary testing approach for Story 3.4. Follow all scenarios to verify acceptance criteria.**

#### Prerequisites

1. **Two User Accounts:** Create or use two existing test accounts (User A and User B)
2. **Test Environment:** iOS Simulator (for banner testing) or physical device (for full testing)
3. **Xcode Console:** Keep console open to view debug logs
4. **Test Data:** At least 2 conversations (1 one-on-one, 1 group chat)

---

#### Test Scenario 1: First Launch - Permission Request

**Objective:** Verify notification permissions are requested on first launch after authentication (AC: 3)

**Steps:**
1. Fresh install app or delete app and reinstall
2. Launch app and sign up/login with User A
3. Observe system permission alert appears
4. Expected: Alert shows "MessageAI Would Like to Send You Notifications"

**Test 1A: Grant Permission**
1. Tap "Allow" on permission alert
2. Check console logs: Should show "Notification permissions: granted"

### Manual Testing Tips

**Console Logging:**
- Watch for debug logs prefixed with "Notification:" or "NotificationManager:"
- Logs should show permission status, suppression decisions, and trigger events

**Simulator vs Device:**
- Simulator: Perfect for in-app banner testing
- Physical Device: Required for full local notification behavior
- Simulator may show notifications differently or not at all

**Common Issues:**
- If notifications don't appear: Check permission status in iOS Settings
- If banner doesn't show: Check console for suppression logs
- If tap doesn't navigate: Check navigation implementation and conversationId

**Testing Efficiency:**
- Use two simulators side-by-side for rapid testing
- Keep Xcode console visible at all times
- Create test conversations beforehand with clear names

### Technical Constraints

**Versions:**
- Swift: 5.9+
- SwiftUI: Latest (iOS 17+)
- iOS SDK: 17.0+
- UNUserNotificationCenter: iOS native

**iOS Local Notifications:**
- Require user permission grant
- Work in foreground and background
- Do NOT work when app is fully terminated (need FCM for that)
- Immediate delivery (not queued by Apple servers)

**In-App Banners:**
- No permissions required (always work)
- Only visible when app is in foreground
- Custom SwiftUI component (full control over UX)

**Firestore Listeners:**
- Real-time updates when app is active
- Automatically reconnect after network interruption
- Must be cleaned up properly to avoid memory leaks

**Limitations (vs. Production FCM):**
- ❌ Won't deliver when app is fully terminated/force-quit
- ❌ No server-side trigger (client must be running listener)
- ❌ No APNs reliability guarantees
- ✅ Perfect for demo and MVP purposes
- ✅ Clean upgrade path to production FCM later

**Performance:**
- In-app banner: Instant (no network delay)
- Local notifications: ~100ms trigger time
- Firestore listener: Real-time (existing architecture)

**Security:**
- No tokens to manage (no security concerns)
- Relies on existing Firestore security rules
- User controls via iOS notification permissions

**Error Handling:**
- Handle permission denials gracefully (don't block app)
- Handle Firestore listener errors with retry logic
- Handle missing conversation data (deleted conversations)
- Log all errors for debugging

### UI/UX Patterns

**In-App Banner (Foreground):**
- Beautiful banner at top of screen
- Slides down with spring animation
- Title: "[SenderName]" or "[SenderName] in [GroupName]"
- Body: Message text preview (1 line, truncated)
- Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds
- Swipe up to dismiss manually
- Tap to navigate to conversation

**Local Notification (Background):**
- iOS system notification
- Same title/body format as in-app banner
- Tapping opens app and navigates to conversation
- System handles delivery and display

**Permission Prompt:**
- Request permissions after user authenticates
- System permission alert: "Allow MessageAI to send you notifications?"
- If denied: Show in-app message with "Open Settings" button
- Don't repeatedly prompt after denial

**Suppression Logic:**
- Don't show notification if user is actively viewing that conversation
- Check current ChatView conversationId before triggering notification
- Applies to both in-app banner and local notifications

**Accessibility:**
- VoiceOver support for in-app banner
- Accessibility labels: "New message notification"
- Accessibility hints: "Tap to open conversation, or swipe up to dismiss"
- System notification accessibility handled by iOS

### Demo Considerations

**What Works in Simulator:**
- ✅ In-app banners (fully testable)
- ✅ Permission prompts
- ✅ Local notification triggers
- ✅ Notification tap navigation
- ⚠️ Local notifications display (simulator may show them differently than device)

**What Requires Physical Device:**
- Local notifications display exactly as on production
- Background notification behavior
- Full system integration testing

**Demo Script:**
1. Show two users in different conversations
2. User A sends message to User B
3. User B sees in-app banner (if in foreground)
4. User B taps banner → navigates to conversation
5. Show suppression: User B in Chat A, receives message for Chat A → no notification
6. Background app → send message → local notification appears

## Dev Agent Record

_This section is populated by the development agent during implementation._

### Agent Model Used

Claude Sonnet 4.5 (via Cursor IDE)

### Debug Log References

Several runtime issues resolved during implementation:
1. **@StateObject with @Observable**: Fixed incompatibility by using @State instead
2. **Firebase Initialization**: Fixed "Firebase not configured" crash by making Firestore reference lazy
3. **@Observable + lazy**: Fixed by using @ObservationIgnored decorator for lazy properties
4. **Firestore Permissions**: Replaced collectionGroup query with per-conversation listeners to work with security rules
5. **Stale Notifications**: Fixed by tracking initial snapshots and skipping notifications on first load

### Completion Notes List

1. **NotificationManager Service Created**: Implemented as @Observable class with full notification coordination, per-conversation Firestore listeners, permission management, and suppression logic
2. **Architecture Pattern**: Uses conversations listener + per-conversation message listeners (not collectionGroup) to work properly with Firestore security rules
3. **Initial Snapshot Handling**: Tracks which conversations completed initial load to prevent stale notifications on login/logout cycles
4. **In-App Banner Component**: Created beautiful SwiftUI banner with animations, gestures (tap/swipe), and accessibility support
5. **Permission Handling**: Integrated permission request on authentication, with graceful denial handling in SettingsView with "Open Settings" button
6. **Navigation Deep Linking**: Implemented using NavigationPath in ConversationListView with NotificationCenter observation
7. **Suppression Logic**: Implemented in ChatView with onAppear/onDisappear hooks to track currently viewed conversation
8. **Unit Tests**: Created comprehensive test suite with 15 test cases covering suppression, banner state, permissions, and edge cases
9. **All Automated Tasks Complete**: 9 of 10 tasks completed. Task 9 (Manual Testing) partially complete (in-app banner tested, background notifications require physical device)
10. **✅ Firebase Rules Verified**: Current security rules work correctly with per-conversation listener approach - no changes needed

### File List

**New Files Created:**
- `ios-app/MessageAI/Services/NotificationManager.swift` - Core notification service
- `ios-app/MessageAI/Views/Shared/NotificationBannerView.swift` - In-app banner UI component
- `ios-app/MessageAITests/NotificationManagerTests.swift` - Unit tests for NotificationManager

**Modified Files:**
- `ios-app/MessageAI/MessageAIApp.swift` - Added NotificationManager initialization, environment injection, banner overlay, and navigation handler
- `ios-app/MessageAI/Views/Chat/ChatView.swift` - Added suppression logic (set/clear currentlyViewedConversationId)
- `ios-app/MessageAI/Views/Conversations/ConversationListView.swift` - Added NavigationPath for deep linking and notification observation
- `ios-app/MessageAI/Views/Settings/SettingsView.swift` - Added notification permission status display and Settings navigation button
