# Story 5.5: Deadline/Reminder Extraction

**Epic:** 5 - AI-Powered Messaging Features  
**Story Points:** 4  
**Priority:** High  
**Assigned To:** @dev  
**Status:** Done

## User Story

**As a** person making commitments in conversations,  
**I want** AI to detect my deadlines and help me set reminders,  
**so that** I don't forget what I promised to do.

---

## Description

AI detects when users make commitments or mention deadlines ("I'll send the docs by tomorrow", "Need to call John this afternoon") and prompts them to set reminders. Reminders are stored with embeddings in Pinecone for semantic search, persisted in Firestore, and trigger local iOS notifications at the due time.

### üéØ Feature Distinction: Reminders vs. Events vs. Decisions

**Reminders** are personal tasks or commitments - **something YOU need to DO by a certain deadline**.

**Key characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ Personal commitment language ("I'll", "I need to", "remind me to")
- ‚úÖ Action verbs ("send", "call", "buy", "pick up")
- ‚úÖ Deadline/due date
- ‚úÖ Triggers iOS notification
- ‚úÖ Can mark complete
- ‚úÖ Personal (not shared)

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "I'll send the documents by 5pm tomorrow" ‚Üê **REMINDER** (task with deadline)
- ‚úÖ "I need to call the dentist this afternoon" ‚Üê **REMINDER** (personal to-do)

**NOT Reminders:**
- ‚ùå "Dinner Friday at 7pm" ‚Üê **EVENT** (social gathering at specific time)
- ‚ùå "Let's meet at Coffee Place" ‚Üê **DECISION** (group agreement, no personal action)

**Why distinguish?**
- Reminders are actionable tasks with notifications
- Events are social gatherings on the calendar
- Decisions are group memory without required actions

**Use case:** "I'll book the restaurant" is a **reminder**. "Dinner Friday 7pm" is an **event**. "Let's go to Italian Place" is a **decision**.

**Key difference from Events:**
- Events = **Something happening** (meeting, party)
- Reminders = **Something to prepare** (book reservation, buy gift)

## Technical Notes

### Architecture Pattern

Reminders follow the same storage pattern as Decisions (Story 5.2) and Events (Story 5.1):
- **iOS ReminderService:** Handles Firestore CRUD operations
- **Backend:** Only handles Pinecone vector storage for semantic search
- **Endpoints:**
  - `POST /reminders/vector` - Store reminder embedding
  - `GET /reminders/search` - Semantic reminder search
  - `DELETE /reminders/vector/{id}` - Delete embedding

This ensures consistency across all AI features (Events, Decisions, Reminders).

### Reminder Detection Prompt
```python
prompt = f"""
Analyze if this message contains a commitment or deadline:
"{message_text}"

Commitment indicators:
- "I'll", "I need to", "remind me to"
- "by tomorrow", "this afternoon", deadlines

Extract:
- task: brief description
- dueDate: ISO8601 format

Return JSON:
{{
  "reminder": {{
    "detected": true/false,
    "task": "Send docs to John",
    "dueDate": "2025-10-24T17:00:00Z"
  }}
}}
"""
```

### Reminder Schema (Firestore)
```typescript
interface Reminder {
  id: string
  userId: string
  title: string
  dueDate: Timestamp
  conversationId: string
  sourceMessageId: string
  completed: boolean
  createdAt: Timestamp
  notificationId?: string
}
```

### Notification Scheduling
```swift
func scheduleReminder(_ reminder: Reminder, timing: ReminderTiming) async throws {
    let content = UNMutableNotificationContent()
    content.title = "Reminder"
    content.body = reminder.title
    content.sound = .default
    content.userInfo = [
        "reminderId": reminder.id,
        "conversationId": reminder.conversationId,
        "messageId": reminder.sourceMessageId,
        "type": "reminder"
    ]
    
    // Calculate trigger time based on timing option
    let triggerDate = calculateTriggerDate(dueDate: reminder.dueDate, timing: timing)
    
    let trigger = UNCalendarNotificationTrigger(
        dateMatching: Calendar.current.dateComponents(
            [.year, .month, .day, .hour, .minute],
            from: triggerDate
        ),
        repeats: false
    )
    
    let request = UNNotificationRequest(
        identifier: reminder.id,
        content: content,
        trigger: trigger
    )
    
    try await UNUserNotificationCenter.current().add(request)
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Test Cases (Primary Validation)

1. **Basic Reminder**
   - "I'll send the report by tomorrow 5pm"
   - Set reminder
   - Verify in Reminders view
   - Verify notification scheduled

2. **Notification Handling**
   - Wait for notification (or test with 1-minute delay)
   - Tap notification
   - Verify opens conversation + scrolls to message

3. **Reminder Completion**
   - Swipe to complete
   - Verify marked complete
   - Verify notification cancelled
   - Verify doesn't appear in active reminders

4. **Semantic Search**
   - Create reminder: "Buy birthday gift"
   - Search: "What do I need to get?"
   - Verify finds the reminder

5. **Multiple Reminders**
   - Create 5 reminders with different due dates
   - Verify sorted by date
   - Verify grouped correctly (TODAY, TOMORROW, etc.)

### Unit Testing (Optional)
Unit tests for reminder detection and date parsing logic may be created but are not required.

**Note:** This story will rely on manual testing for end-to-end validation. Unit tests are optional and may be skipped to meet timeline constraints.

---

## Notes

- Reminders are personal (not shared with chat participants)
- Notification reliability is critical - use iOS best practices
- Consider timezone handling for due dates
- Keep UI clean - don't overwhelm with too many reminders
