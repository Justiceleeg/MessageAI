# Story 5.2: Decision Detection and Tracking

**Epic:** 5 - AI-Powered Messaging Features  
**Story Points:** 4  
**Priority:** High  
**Assigned To:** @dev  
**Status:** Done

---

## User Story

**As a** busy person making plans with friends,  
**I want** AI to detect and log decisions from our conversations using full conversation context,  
**so that** I can easily reference what we agreed to without scrolling through messages.

---

## Description

This story implements AI-powered decision detection and tracking. When users send messages that confirm decisions, the AI uses **lightweight RAG** (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to:
1. Retrieve recent conversation context from Pinecone
2. Analyze the decision with full context (not just the current message)
3. Extract a complete, contextual decision summary

For example:
- Without context: "Yeah, sounds good" ‚Üí Vague decision ‚ùå
- With context: "Going to Italian restaurant on Main Street" ‚Üí Complete decision ‚úÖ

The system stores decisions in both Firestore and Pinecone, enabling semantic search and navigation back to source messages.

### üéØ Feature Distinction: Decisions vs. Events vs. Reminders

**Decisions** are group agreements or conclusions - **what was decided/agreed upon, no action required**.

**Key characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ Group agreement language ("let's do", "we decided", "sounds good")
- ‚úÖ Past-tense or confirmed
- ‚úÖ Reference/memory tool
- ‚ùå No specific time (just recorded agreement)
- ‚ùå No action required
- ‚ùå No notifications

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "Let's go to the Italian restaurant" ‚Üê **DECISION** (group agreement)
- ‚úÖ "We decided on the blue design" ‚Üê **DECISION** (conclusion reached)

**NOT Decisions:**
- ‚ùå "Dinner Friday at 7pm" ‚Üê **EVENT** (specific time, goes on calendar)
- ‚ùå "I'll book the restaurant tomorrow" ‚Üê **REMINDER** (task you need to do)

**Why distinguish?**
- Decisions are for group memory ("What did we agree on?")
- Events are for calendar scheduling (specific date/time)
- Reminders are for personal accountability (tasks to complete)

**Use case:** "Let's get Italian food" is a **decision**. "Dinner at Italian Place Friday 7pm" is an **event**. "I'll make the reservation" is a **reminder**.

**See full comparison:** `docs/AI-FEATURES-OVERVIEW.md`

## Technical Notes

### Lightweight RAG Implementation
```python
# In /analyze-message endpoint
from app.services.vector_store import get_vector_store
from app.services.openai_service import get_openai_service

def analyze_message_for_decisions(message_text, conversation_id, user_id):
    vector_store = get_vector_store()
    openai_service = get_openai_service()
    
    # Step 1: Retrieve recent context (lightweight RAG)
    recent_messages = vector_store.search_similar_messages(
        query=message_text,
        k=5,
        filter_dict={"conversation_id": conversation_id}
    )
    
    # Step 2: Build context string
    context = "\n".join([
        f"{msg['metadata'].get('sender', 'User')}: {msg['content']}"
        for msg in recent_messages
    ])
    
    # Step 3: Create contextual prompt
    prompt = f"""
Previous conversation:
{context}

Current message: "{message_text}"

Analyze if this message confirms or makes a decision. Use the previous conversation context to extract a COMPLETE decision statement.

Examples:
- "Yeah, sounds good" + context about Italian restaurant ‚Üí "Going to Italian restaurant on Main Street"
- "Let's do 3pm" + context about meeting ‚Üí "Meeting at 3pm on Friday"

Return JSON:
{{
  "decision": {{
    "detected": true/false,
    "text": "complete decision statement using context"
  }}
}}
"""
    
    # Step 4: Call GPT-4o-mini with context
    response = openai_service.chat_completion(
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        temperature=0.3
    )
    
    return parse_decision_response(response)
```

### Decision Detection Prompt
*(Included in Lightweight RAG Implementation above - no separate simple prompt needed)*

### Decision Schema (Firestore)
```typescript
interface Decision {
  id: string
  userId: string
  text: string
  conversationId: string
  sourceMessageId: string
  timestamp: Timestamp
}
```

## Completion Notes (Oct 24, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Successfully Implemented

**Backend:**
- ‚úÖ **Lightweight RAG** for context retrieval using Pinecone vector search
- ‚úÖ **Fixed LangChain compatibility issue** with `from_existing_index` pattern
- ‚úÖ **Decision vector storage endpoints**: POST /decisions/vector, DELETE /decisions/vector/{id}
- ‚úÖ **Semantic decision search**: GET /decisions/search
- ‚úÖ **Architecture fix**: Backend only handles vector storage (Pinecone), iOS client handles Firestore
  - Matches existing Events/Reminders pattern (consistent architecture!)
  - No Firebase Admin SDK needed on backend

**iOS:**
- ‚úÖ **DecisionConfirmationView** modal for confirming AI-detected decisions
- ‚úÖ **DecisionsListView** reusable component for per-chat and global views
- ‚úÖ **DecisionService.swift** for Firestore CRUD operations (matches EventService/ReminderService)
- ‚úÖ **Integrated with AI prompt system** - "Save decision" button appears inline with timestamp
- ‚úÖ **AIBackendService** only handles semantic search (not CRUD)

### üîß Technical Highlights

1. **LangChain Fix**: Changed from `PineconeVectorStore(index=...)` to `PineconeVectorStore.from_existing_index(index_name=...)` to fix compatibility with Pinecone SDK 5.0+
   
2. **RAG Context Retrieval**: Successfully retrieves k=5 recent messages and passes to GPT-4o-mini for contextual decision extraction
   
3. **Complete Decision Statements**: "Yeah, sounds good" + context ‚Üí "Going to Italian restaurant on Main Street" ‚ú®

4. **Architecture Consistency**: Fixed to match Events/Reminders pattern:
   - **iOS Client**: Handles Firestore CRUD (via `DecisionService.swift`)
   - **Backend**: Only handles vector storage for semantic search (via Pinecone)
   - **Result**: No Firebase Admin SDK needed, cleaner separation of concerns

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deferred Items

- **Message Navigation** (AC5/AC6, Task 9): Tapping "Go to message" button is deferred to Story 5.1.5 (unified message navigation feature across Events, Reminders, and Decisions)

### üìù Configuration Notes

**Backend .env required:**
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=...
PINECONE_API_KEY=...
# NOTE: Firebase Admin SDK NOT required (decisions stored by iOS client)
```

**iOS Config:**
- Uses `Config.backendURL` from `.xcconfig` files for environment management
- Debug build defaults to `http://localhost:8000`
- Release build uses deployed backend URL

---

## Files Changed

### Backend (Python)
1. **`app/routes/decisions.py`** - Refactored to vector-only endpoints
   - `POST /api/v1/decisions/vector` - Store decision embedding
   - `GET /api/v1/decisions/search` - Semantic search
   - `DELETE /api/v1/decisions/vector/{id}` - Delete embedding
   - Removed all Firestore operations

2. **`app/models/requests.py`** - Updated `DecisionCreateRequest`
   - Added `decisionId` (iOS-generated)
   - Added `timestamp` (iOS-generated)

3. **`app/models/responses.py`** - Cleaned up response models
   - Removed `DecisionListResponse` and `DecisionItem`

### iOS (Swift)
5. **`Services/DecisionService.swift`** - ‚≠ê NEW service for Firestore CRUD
   - `createDecision()` - Stores in Firestore + backend vector
   - `listDecisions()` - Lists from Firestore
   - `deleteDecision()` - Deletes from Firestore + backend vector
   - Matches EventService/ReminderService architecture

6. **`Services/AIBackendService.swift`** - Simplified to search-only

## Verification Results ‚úÖ

**Tested on Oct 24, 2025:**

```bash
# 1. Store decision vector
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/decisions/vector \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "decisionId": "dec_test_456",
    "text": "Going to Italian restaurant on Main Street",
    "userId": "user_test",
    "conversationId": "conv_test_123",
    "messageId": "msg_test_123",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-24T15:30:00Z"
  }'
# Result: {"success":true,"decisionId":"dec_test_456","message":"Decision vector stored successfully"}
# ‚úÖ PASSED

# 2. Search decisions semantically
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/decisions/search?user_id=user_test&query=restaurant&k=5"
# Result: {"results":[{"decisionId":"dec_test_456","text":"Going to Italian restaurant on Main Street",...,"similarity":0.95}]}
# ‚úÖ PASSED

# 3. Delete decision vector
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/api/v1/decisions/vector/dec_test_456
# Result: {"success":true,"message":"Decision vector deleted successfully"}
# ‚úÖ PASSED
```

**All endpoints working correctly!** ‚ú®

---

### üéâ Key Achievement

**RAG is working!** The system now understands conversation context and generates complete, meaningful decision statements from vague agreement phrases. This is the core differentiator of Story 5.2.

**Architecture is now consistent!** Decisions match the Events/Reminders pattern with clean separation between iOS (Firestore) and backend (Pinecone).

---

## Dependencies

**Upstream:** Story 5.0 (Backend Foundation), Story 5.1 (Message analysis)

**Downstream:** None

---

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Test Cases (Primary Validation)

1. **Context-Aware Decision Detection**
   - Conversation: "Should we do Italian or Mexican?" ‚Üí "What about that place on Main Street?"
   - Send: "Yeah, let's do that"
   - Expected: Decision detected as "Going to Italian restaurant on Main Street" (NOT just "let's do that")

2. **Self-Contained Decision**
   - Send: "Let's meet at Coffee Place Friday at 3pm"
   - Expected: Decision detected as "Meeting at Coffee Place Friday at 3pm" (works even without context)

3. **Semantic Search**
   - Log: "Going to Italian restaurant"
   - Search: "What did we decide about dinner?"
   - Expected: Finds the restaurant decision

4. **No Decision Detection**
   - Send: "How are you?"
   - Expected: No decision prompt appears

5. **Decision Persistence & Navigation**
   - Create decision from message
   - View in Decisions tab
   - Tap decision
   - Expected: Navigate to source message, highlight briefly

### Unit Testing (Optional)
Unit tests for lightweight RAG logic and decision parsing may be created but are not required.

**Note:** This story will rely on manual testing for end-to-end validation. Unit tests are optional and may be skipped to meet timeline constraints.

---

## Notes

- **Lightweight RAG is the key differentiator** - decisions are contextually complete, not vague
- Decision tracking is unique - most apps don't do this
- Keep UI clean - decisions should enhance, not clutter
- Vector search makes semantic search feel "magical"
- The existing `VectorStoreService.search_similar_messages()` from 5.0 is perfect for this
