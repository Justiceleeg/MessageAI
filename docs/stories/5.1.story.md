# Story 5.1: Smart Calendar Extraction

**Epic:** 5 - AI-Powered Messaging Features  
**Story Points:** 4  
**Priority:** High  
**Assigned To:** @dev  
**Status:** Done

---

## User Story

**As a** busy person coordinating plans with friends,  
**I want** the app to detect calendar events in my messages and help me create them,  
**so that** I don't have to manually track dates and times from conversations.

---

## Description

When a user sends a message containing a calendar event (date, time, location), the AI automatically detects it and displays an "➕ Add to calendar?" button below their message bubble. Clicking opens a modal where the user can review and confirm the extracted details before adding it to their calendar.

This feature uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to extract structured event data from natural language, generates embeddings for event deduplication using vector search, and stores events in Firestore for real-time sync.

### 🎯 Feature Distinction: Events vs. Reminders vs. Decisions

**Events** are social gatherings, meetings, or appointments - **something happening at a specific date/time with multiple people**.

**Key characteristics:**
- ✅ Specific date AND time ("Friday at 7pm")
- ✅ Multiple people involved (attendees)
- ✅ Location-based
- ✅ Shows on calendar grid

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Dinner at Italian restaurant Friday 7pm" ← **EVENT**
- ✅ "Coffee meeting tomorrow at 3pm" ← **EVENT**

**NOT Events:**
- ❌ "I'll send the docs by Friday" ← **REMINDER** (task with deadline, no specific time)
- ❌ "Let's go to Italian restaurant" ← **DECISION** (agreement, no specific time)

**Why distinguish?** 
- Events need calendar visualization and attendee tracking
- Reminders are personal tasks with notifications
- Decisions are group memory without time constraints

**See full comparison:** `docs/AI-FEATURES-OVERVIEW.md`

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Message Analysis Detects Events
- [x] AI analyzes outgoing messages after they're sent
- [x] Detects date references: "tomorrow", "Friday", "Oct 25", "next week"
- [x] Detects time references: "3pm", "at 7:00", "noon", "morning"
- [x] Detects location: "at Coffee Place", "my house", addresses
- [x] Extracts event title from context: "dinner", "meeting", "party"
- [x] Returns structured JSON with event details

### AC2: AI Prompt Displayed
- [x] "➕ Add to calendar?" button appears below user's message
- [x] Button only shows if calendar event detected
- [x] Button positioned inline with message timestamp (refined from original spec)
- [x] Button has gentle, non-intrusive styling
- [x] Only highest-priority prompt shown per message (Event > Reminder > Decision)

### AC3: Event Creation Modal
- [x] Tapping button opens modal
- [x] Modal pre-fills with AI-extracted data:
  - Title (editable text field)
  - Date (date picker, default to extracted date)
  - Time (time picker, optional)
  - Location (editable text field, optional)
- [x] "Cancel" button dismisses modal
- [x] "Create Event" button validates and saves
- [x] Modal uses native iOS design patterns

### AC4: Event Stored in Firestore
- [x] Event document created in `events` collection
- [x] Schema matches technical spec:
  ```
  - id, title, date, time, location
  - creatorUserId, createdAt
  - createdInConversationId, createdAtMessageId
  - invitations: {} (empty for now)
  - attendees: {userId: {status: "pending"}} (creator)
  ```
- [x] Event saved with proper user permissions
- [x] Real-time listeners update calendar view (via EventService)

### AC5: Vector Embedding Generated
- [x] iOS calls backend: `POST /events/create`
- [x] Backend generates embedding for event title + date
- [x] Embedding stored in Pinecone namespace "events"
- [x] Metadata includes: eventId, title, date, userId
- [x] Embedding used for future deduplication

### AC6: Event Deduplication (Basic)
- [x] Before creating event, search Pinecone for similar events
- [x] If similarity > 0.85, show modal: "Link to existing event?"
- [x] Options: "Yes, link" or "No, create new"
- [x] If link: Add to existing event's invitations
- [x] If new: Create separate event
- [x] Simple matching for MVP (title + date similarity)

### AC7: Message Linking
- [x] Event stores `createdAtMessageId` reference
- [ ] From calendar view, user can navigate to creation message (deferred to Story 5.1.5)
- [ ] Tapping event → Event details → "Jump to Message" button (deferred to Story 5.1.5)
- [ ] Navigates to conversation, scrolls to message (deferred to Story 5.1.5)
- [ ] Message briefly highlighted (deferred to Story 5.1.5)

### AC8: Error Handling
- [x] If backend unavailable, no AI prompt shown (silent failure)
- [x] If event creation fails, show error: "Failed to create event. Try again?"
- [x] Network errors handled gracefully
- [x] Offline: No AI analysis (existing offline queue still works)

## Technical Notes

### OpenAI Prompt Structure
```python
prompt = f"""
Analyze this message for calendar events:
"{message_text}"

Extract:
- title: brief event name
- date: ISO 8601 format
- time: HH:MM format or null
- location: place name or null

Return JSON:
{{
  "calendar": {{
    "detected": true/false,
    "title": "...",
    "date": "2025-10-27",
    "time": "15:00",
    "location": "Coffee Place"
  }}
}}
"""
```

### Event Schema (Firestore)
```typescript
interface Event {
  id: string
  title: string
  date: Timestamp
  time?: string  // "HH:MM"
  location?: string
  creatorUserId: string
  createdAt: Timestamp
  createdInConversationId: string
  createdAtMessageId: string
  invitations: Record<string, {
    messageId: string
    invitedUserIds: string[]
  }>
  attendees: Record<string, {
    status: "pending" | "accepted" | "declined"
    rsvpMessageId?: string
    rsvpConversationId?: string
    rsvpAt?: Timestamp
  }>
}
```

### Vector Metadata (Pinecone)
```json
{
  "id": "evt_123",
  "values": [0.123, ...],  // 1536-dim
  "metadata": {
    "event_id": "evt_123",
    "title": "Coffee meeting",
    "date": "2025-10-27",
    "user_id": "user_456",
    "type": "event"
  }
}
```

## Dependencies

**Upstream:** 
- Story 5.0 (Python Backend Foundation)
- Story 5.0.5 (iOS Data Models & Services - Event model required)

**Downstream:** 
- Story 5.1.5 (Calendar UI - displays events)
- Story 5.4 (RSVP Tracking uses events)

---

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Test Cases (Primary Validation)

1. **Basic Event Detection**
   - Send: "Let's grab coffee tomorrow at 3pm"
   - Expected: AI prompt appears, modal shows "coffee" / tomorrow / 15:00

2. **Multiple Date Formats**
   - "Dinner Friday"
   - "Meeting on Oct 25"
   - "Party next Saturday at 8"
   - Expected: All correctly parsed

3. **Location Extraction**
   - "Meet at Starbucks downtown"
   - Expected: Location pre-filled

4. **No Event Detection**
   - "How are you?"
   - Expected: No AI prompt

5. **Event Deduplication**
   - Create "Birthday party Friday"
   - In another chat: "Birthday party Friday"
   - Expected: "Link to existing event?" prompt

6. **Message Navigation**
   - Create event from message
   - View in calendar
   - Tap "Jump to message"
   - Expected: Scroll to message, highlight

### Unit Testing (Optional)
Unit tests for OpenAI API integration and event parsing logic may be created but are not required.

**Note:** This story will rely on manual testing for end-to-end validation. Unit tests are optional and may be skipped to meet timeline constraints.

---

## Notes

- Keep AI prompt subtle and non-intrusive
- Event creation should feel fast (<2 seconds total)
- Deduplication is basic for MVP (title + date similarity)
- Advanced features (recurring events, all-day) are out of scope

**Key Features:**
- 🤖 GPT-4o-mini comprehensively analyzes messages for multiple features in one pass
- 📅 Events distinguished from reminders and decisions (date+time vs deadline vs agreement)
- 🔍 Vector similarity search prevents duplicate event creation
- 🎨 Subtle, non-intrusive AI prompts inline with message timestamp

**Testing Notes:**
- ✅ Ready for manual testing with localhost backend (port 8000)
- ✅ Backend endpoints tested and functional with curl
- ✅ iOS builds successfully without errors
- ✅ iOS Simulator configured to connect to localhost backend
- ✅ End-to-end flow: Send message → AI analyzes → Prompt appears → Create event → Save to Firestore → Prompt disappears
- ✅ Deduplication flow: Similar event detected → Alert shown → User chooses link or create new
- ✅ All build errors resolved (Codable conformance, static method calls, async/await)

### Debug Log

**Issue 1: Multiple AI Prompts Appearing**
- Problem: Both "Add to calendar?" and "Save decision?" appearing on the same message
- Solution: Implemented priority system with if-else chain (Event > Reminder > Decision)
- Result: Only highest-priority relevant prompt displayed

**Issue 2: AI Button UI Refinement**
- Problem: AI button too large, wanted next to message timestamp
- Solution: Created AIPromptButtonCompact, refactored MessageBubbleView to be generic
- Result: Compact button now inline with timestamp on same line

**Issue 3: AI Button Persistence**
- Problem: AI button should disappear after user acts on suggestion
- Solution: Added dismissedAISuggestions Set to ChatViewModel, calls dismissAISuggestion() on event creation
- Result: Button auto-hides after user creates event

**Issue 4: Build Errors**
- Error: `parseDate`/`parseTime` static member access
- Fix: Changed to `Self.parseDate` and `Self.parseTime`
- Error: `AuthService()` missing parameter
- Fix: Changed to `AuthService.shared` singleton
- Error: `Event` initializer extra argument 'id'
- Fix: Changed to `eventId` parameter
- Error: `signOut()` not marked with `await`
- Fix: Added `await` keyword
- Error: `MessageAnalysisRequest` not Codable
- Fix: Changed `userCalendar` from `[[String: Any]]?` to `[String]?`
- Error: Generic parameter inference in previews
- Fix: Explicitly passed `EmptyView()` closure

**Issue 5: Localhost Testing Setup**
- Action: Configured AIBackendService to use `http://127.0.0.1:8000` for iOS Simulator
- Action: Updated default initialization to use localURL
- Result: Ready for localhost testing without backend deployment

**Note:** Message navigation feature (AC7) deferred to Story 5.1.5 (Calendar UI) as it requires calendar view to navigate from. Event creation stores `createdAtMessageId` for future navigation support.
