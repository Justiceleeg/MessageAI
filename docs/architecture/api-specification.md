# API Specification

**API Style**: N/A (Direct Firebase SDK Integration)

**Rationale**: For the MVP, the iOS client application will interact directly with Firebase Auth and Firestore using the official Firebase iOS SDKs. This approach leverages Firebase's real-time synchronization and offline persistence features directly on the client, simplifying the backend requirements for the core messaging functionality. An explicit API layer (like REST or GraphQL) is not required for the client-database interaction. Cloud Functions will be used for specific backend triggers (like push notifications) rather than serving a general-purpose API.
