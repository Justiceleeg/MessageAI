# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for MessageAI, including backend systems (Firebase), the frontend iOS implementation (SwiftUI), and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This unified approach combines backend and frontend architecture concerns for this modern mobile application.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Status**: N/A - Greenfield project.

**Rationale**: This is a new native iOS application. Development will likely begin using a standard Xcode project template for SwiftUI applications. Firebase SDKs and configurations will be added manually according to Firebase documentation and best practices. No specific pre-built "fullstack" starter template incorporating both native iOS and Firebase backend logic is being used.
