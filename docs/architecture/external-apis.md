# External APIs

**Status**: None required for MVP.

**Rationale**: The MVP architecture relies entirely on the integrated Firebase ecosystem and native iOS platform capabilities. No additional third-party external API integrations are required to fulfill the defined MVP requirements.

**(Post-MVP Note)**: Integrations with external LLM APIs will be required for the AI features.
