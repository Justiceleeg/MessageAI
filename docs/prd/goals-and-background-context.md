# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- **Primary Goal (MVP)**: Successfully build and deploy a production-quality messaging app that meets all MVP requirements within the 24-hour sprint deadline.
- **Secondary Goal (Project)**: Create a robust, reliable, and scalable messaging infrastructure comparable to WhatsApp, capable of serving as a foundation for advanced AI features.
- **Final Goal (Project)**: Successfully implement all 5 required AI features and one advanced AI capability tailored to a specific user persona by the final 7-day deadline.

## Background Context

The core technical challenge of modern messaging is twofold. First, building a production-quality infrastructure is complex, requiring solutions for real-time delivery, offline support, and data sync. Second, as communication volume increases, users face significant pain points like information overload, language barriers, and scheduling chaos that basic messaging does not solve.

This project addresses the urgent need to bridge that gap by first building a reliable messaging engine (the MVP) and then layering on intelligent AI features to make communication more productive, accessible, and meaningful.
