# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The user experience must be fast, reliable, and intuitive, prioritizing function over flash. The design should get out of the way and let the user communicate. It must gracefully handle poor network conditions and offline states, clearly communicating the status of messages (e.g., sending, sent, delivered, read).

## Key Interaction Paradigms

The app will follow established, native iOS messaging patterns. The primary interaction will be a standard conversation list view that drills into a chat view. Gestures and interactions should feel native to the iOS platform.

**Theme Support:**

The UI must automatically respond to the user's system-preferred theme (Dark Mode or Light Mode).

A setting must be provided to allow the user to override this behavior and manually select one of three options:
- System Default
- Always Light
- Always Dark

## Core Screens and Views

- **Authentication View**: A screen for user sign-up and login.
- **Conversation List View**: A list of all active 1:1 and group conversations, showing the contact/group name and the last message.
- **Chat View**: The main interface for a single conversation, showing the message history, a text input field, and a send button.
- **Contact/Profile View**: A simple view to display user profile information.
- **Settings View**: A view to manage preferences, including the new theme setting.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The app should aim for WCAG AA compliance to be accessible.

## Branding

(TBD - Assumed to be clean, minimalist, and professional. No specific branding guidelines provided.)

## Target Device and Platforms: iOS

The app will be built as a native iOS application using Swift and SwiftUI.
